        <h1>Sita ramam movie review</h1>
        <p>When the title of the film was announced as Sita Ramam, I groaned thinking do we need another film where the protagonists are called Sita and Ram to convince us of their love story. But as the story unfolds you realize that as a viewer you are being deceived, and in a good way. This is one of the pleasant ways that Hanu Raghavapudi surprises the audience with some of the screenplay choices he makes. His previous films struggled with pacing issues. He’d have a fantastic set-up but the film would whimper out as it reached the climax. The superb love triangle in Andala Rakshasi gets nowhere near the dramatic meat promised early on. The hilarious first act of Krishna Gaadi Veera Prema Gaadha, which I consider his best work till Sita Ramam, becomes very simple and flat in the third act. Padi Padi Leche Manasu suffered more seriously from the “boring second half” syndrome than Sai Pallavi’s Vaishali suffered from a mental condition in that film.</p>

           <p> To make up for those lost opportunities, Hanu Raghavapudi this time, has chosen two stories to tell. First is the one that’s familiar from all the promotional material. Lieutenant Ram (Dulquer Salmaan) is an orphaned soldier who loves his country, believes in religious tolerance, and is of the belief that Pakistan Army and Pakistan citizens are two different entities. One day an act of valor at the border, which saves a riot from breaking out, makes Ram famous across the nation. And soon he begins to get letters from various parts of the country with each person claiming to be his mother, sister, aunt, with all strangers promising him that he’s not an orphan – a country that’s his whole family. But amidst them is a letter from Sita Mahalakshmi (Mrunal Thakur) who claims to be his wife. Who is Ram? Who is Sita? Are they really married? </p>
